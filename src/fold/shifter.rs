/// A folder that adjusts debruijn indices by a certain amount.
///
/// Typically, `up_shift` is used when inserting some term T under a
/// binder (or multiple binders). So for example if we had some goal
/// like `T: Trait<?X>`, where `?X` refers to an inference variable,
/// but we wanted to construct a goal like `exists<U> { T = U, T:
/// Trait<?X> }`, we might use `up_shift`.  This is because,
/// internally, the inference variable `?X` (as well as the new
/// quantified variable `U`) are going to be represented by debruijn
/// indices. So if the index of `X` is zero, then while originally we
/// might have had `T: Trait<?0>`, inside the `exists` we want to
/// represent `X` with `?1`, to account for the binder:
///
/// ```notrust
///     exists { T = ?0, T: Trait<?1> }
///                  ^^           ^^ refers to `?X`
///                  refers to `U`
/// ```
